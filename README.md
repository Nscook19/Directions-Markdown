# Perfecting the Barbell Bench Press  
## What is a barbell bench press?
The barbell bench press is an exercise that can help you build up your chest muscles.  This set of instructions will teach you not only how to do a bench press, but to perfect it. 
# Warning!
**Potential injury could occur if you do not do the exercise the right way** 

# Steps  
### 1. Locating the proper bench
* Check for a bench that has a rack for a barbell
* If you are by yourself, find a rack that has safety bars
  
### 2. Determine the weight you should try to lift
* If you are new to lifting, set up the barbell with nothing on it
* If you know what you can lift, set up accordingly
  
### 3. Positioning
* Lay flat on the bench with feet firmly planted
* Your eyes should be directly below the barbell
* Arch your back to create a gap in between your lower back and the bench
* Tense your upper back and push it into the bench

### 4. Holding the barbell
* Grip the barbell slightly wider than your shoulders
* Firmly grasp the barbell, to ensure it can not move
**Note:** There are different ways to hold the barbell, but this is the standard
  
### 5. Unracking the barbell  
* Take a deep breath to brace your core
* Push the barbell up and outwards from the rack

### 6. Lowering the barbell
* Lower the barbell to the bottom of chest
* Ensure it gently touches before completing the next step
**Note:** this process should take anywhere from 1 to 2 seconds
  
### 7. Pressing the barbell
* Immediately push the barbell back up once it touches your lower chest
* It should go up and slightly back towards the rack without hitting the rack

### 8. Doing reps
* After completing steps 6 and 7, decide if more reps are achievable
* If they are, repeat steps 6 and 7 until you are too fatigued to do any more
**WARNING:** Attempting too many reps than your body can handle can cause injury, know your limits!!

### 9. Reracking 
* Once the desired reps are completed, press the bar up and lock your elbows
* Carefully move the barbell back into the rack
* Slide the bar down the rack until it is caught by the rack hooks
  
### 10. More Sets
* Once steps 3 - 8 are completed, decide whether you want to do more sets
* A range from 2 anywhere to 6 is reccomended, but this is your decision
